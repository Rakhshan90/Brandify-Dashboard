# Brandify dashboard

The Brandify dashboard is a web application. Using the REST APIs that I created, the admin can now create, read, update, and delete users and products.

Brandify's dashboard displays user analytics, transactions, new member joinings, and monthly revenue derived from the REST APIs I developed.


## Appendix

The REST APIs are all derived from my backend application

## Lessons Learned


- In this project, I learned how to connect a database to a React application and how to use Rest APIs for retrieving and manipulating database data.

- Through Rest APIs, I learned how to render data on the front end retrieved from the database.

What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- The most challenging part was manipulating database data and redux for dispatch actions, as well as retrieving the admin identity in order to provide access to the application.
